# Repo - Online articles

A grabbag of various scripts and data files for my online articles

## Getting Started

Each set of datafiles and scripts will be organised in their own subdirectories, with their own README file or text note (unless I've forgotten :( )).

### Prerequisites

Python (and patience for any of my mistakes or omissions)
